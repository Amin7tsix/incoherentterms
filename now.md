I'm Amin Zamani, 28 years old and from Iran. In my PhD, I work with **ultracold atoms**, exploring how these systems can shape the future of **computing**, **navigation**, **sensing**, and **biology**. I'm interested in bridging the gap between **academic research** and **real-world applications**, and finding ways to transfer know-how from the lab into industry.

**What Iâ€™m happy about these days:**
  * Iâ€™ve been going to the gym regularly for the past few months â€” itâ€™s finally becoming a *habit*!
  * Iâ€™m really enjoying reading *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman.
  * I'm making some [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/@amin_zamani) videos about quantum technologies. So far only in Persian.
  * Iâ€™m working on making my blog look nicer and more fun to read.


Thanks for stopping by â€” Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re here. ðŸŒ±
