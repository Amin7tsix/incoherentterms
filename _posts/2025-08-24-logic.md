When talking with friends, I’ve noticed a certain bitterness in strictly logical, precise speech — it can sting and sometimes hurt feelings. I’ve always believed that being logical is a good thing: it makes discussions clearer, provides common ground for arguments, and ensures that everyone avoids confusion or misunderstanding. Yet, it doesn’t always work out for the best.

To keep conversations strictly logical, you sometimes have to be a little harsh. You need to disagree often, to prevent people from slipping in faulty premises. If someone makes a statistical claim, you feel compelled to check whether they’re using the right reasoning. Everyday conversations are full of hindsight bias, sweeping generalizations, and conclusions drawn from tiny datasets. Even word choice becomes something to police: is it *always* or *sometimes*? *All men*, *some men*, or *the average man*? You get the idea.  

In a professional setting, this kind of rigor is valuable. But with friends, it often leaves people less happy than when the conversation started — and happiness is kind of the whole point of spending time together. Among friends, we expect to be heard, understood, accepted, and even allowed to make mistakes without feeling judged. Warmth and scrutiny rarely coexist easily.  

People naturally get defensive when criticized. And it’s difficult to face too much criticism at once. Admitting you were wrong is a healthy practice, but it’s also extremely hard to do — maybe because it’s difficult to separate our *opinions* from our *identity*.

### In short

Logic is an incredible tool, but friendship isn’t a debate. Perhaps the real challenge is knowing when to prioritize accuracy and when to let warmth take the lead. After all, the goal with friends isn’t to win an argument — it’s to share time and leave each other feeling lighter.
