I watched *BlackBerry* yesterday. It is a movie based on what happened to BlackBerry, the cell phone manufacturing business. I tend to enjoy movies based on real stories. They can be both amusing and informative. I don't know much about BlackBerry's business other than what the movie presented. I recommend watching it to people who enjoy thinking about the working style and growth dynamics of technology startups.

I don't intend to comment on the cinematography of the movie. I spent a pleasant 2 hours watching it and that's sufficient. It motivated me to refresh my memory of Paul Graham's *Founder Mode* essay. Graham writes "C-level execs, as a class, include some of the most skillful liars in the world" :) I remembered this when Jim Balsillie lied about liking Hockey at a lunch meeting with a potential acquirer to avoid disrupting the coherence of their momentary like-mindedness. 

Another alarming scene for me was the deal that Jim Balsillie initially offered to Mike Lazaridis and Doug Fregin â€” 50% of the company and becoming its CEO in exchange of putting it on the right track. It is of course part of reality that the actual makers of the intellectual property are not always the ones who enjoy its potential financial value. This is especially the case in academic research groups. But it sometimes happens in industry settings as well. It's similar to hydroelectric energy generation. The potential energy is right there behind the dam, but it needs a turbine to cash it.

For people who enjoy working on the tech, the story is a reminder that investing in softer skills can be just as important for long-term success.
