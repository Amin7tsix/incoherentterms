                <title>A Glimpse Into My Nonlinear Optics Experiment</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;While going through some old lab photos, I found a short video from my master’s thesis experiment — just 15 seconds long, but it brought back so many memories from the lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://youtube.com/embed/e6lqZKQJmj4?feature=share&quot; style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It shows a Lithium Niobate thin film mounted on an XYZ translation stage, sitting neatly between two miniature lenses (each with a 4.5 mm focal length):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Part of the optical setup&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
During the recording, the sample is illuminated by infrared light generated through a parametric down-conversion (PDC) process in a BIBO crystal. The motivation for generating the pump light via PDC was to have an easy way to tune the wavelength over a large range. We needed this to study the wavelength dependence of the SHG process in Lithium Niobate, i.e., the dependence of its second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi_2$ on the pump wavelength. The BIBO crystal was pumped with a pulsed 532 nm laser, and by tuning the crystal angle — mounted on a rotation stage — we could achieve signal/idler wavelengths ranging from about 1100 nm up to around 1700 nm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the video, as the wavelength of the pump light changes, the Lithium Niobate glows in different colors — in the visible range. That glow comes from second-harmonic generation (SHG), where the material converts light into new colors by doubling its frequency. In this experiment, the main goal was actually to study another nonlinear crystal: Gallium Selenide (GaSe). It is possible to make very thin layers of GaSe and use them to generate entangled photon pairs via SPDC. The Gallium Selenide sample was installed side by side with the Lithium Niobate on the translation stage. Having them both on the same stage allowed for easy switching between the two samples. Because Lithium Niobate produced a stronger signal, it served as a convenient reference for calibration and verification. Here’s another picture showing both samples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Looking back, I love how this short clip captures the magic of experimental optics — when something invisible suddenly becomes visible in a burst of color.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Compact double-pass AOM setup</title>
                <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025-10-11/20251011_AOM_diffraction_from_Saleh_and_Teich_book
.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Bragg diffraction schematic from Fundamentals of Photonics textbook by Saleh and Teich&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Bragg diffraction&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Double-pass your AOM!&lt;br /&gt;
It’s actually pretty cool. When you retro-reflect the diffracted light back into the AOM and diffract it in the same order again (like +1 and +1, or -1 and -1), a few nice things happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tuning range: &lt;br /&gt;
There will be an effectively larger tuning range of the radio frequency drive. Because a df change of the drive frequency translates to a 2.df frequency change on the light.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pointing: &lt;br /&gt;
If the AOM is placed in the focal plane of a lens followed by the retro-reflector, the pointing of the twice-diffracted light stays fixed when the drive frequency is changed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thermal sensitivity: &lt;br /&gt;
Because of feature number 2, the typical temperature sensitivity in AOMs that leads to beam pointing instability can be largely mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently wanted to divide my laser beam into 5 branches and set up a double-pass AOM for each branch. They are then used for Raman sideband cooling in a Ytterbium tweezer experiment. Because I wanted to push the setup for compactness, I ended up using a polarizing beamsplitter cube glued on a mirror mount together with the AOM on a mirror mount. Combined, they provide 4 degrees of freedom to align the beam position into the AOM crystal and hit the Bragg angle of the crystal. Here’s the schematic of this arrangement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025-10-11/20251011_double_pass_AOMs.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;Schematic of the optical setup&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Schematic of the optical setup&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a top view of the experimental setup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025-10-11/20251011_double_pass_AOM_setup_from_the_lab
.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;The experimental setup&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The experimental setup of the double-pass AOMs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gives me satisfaction to see all 4 ports of each cube being used!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus (!): &lt;br /&gt;
If the retro-reflector is exactly f away from the lens, i.e. a cat’s eye arrangement, a collimated beam entering the AOM leaves collimated after twice diffraction. Now, if the retro-reflector is moved back and forth, the beam’s divergence can be tuned. This means that if we are focusing the double-diffracted light using a single lens, the focal point can be moved along the optical axis. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07633&quot;&gt;recent work&lt;/a&gt; from Manuel Endres team, authors propose using a grating as the retro-reflector which enables using the acoustic diffraction frequency to move the beam’s focus position along the optical axis.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Single-lens imaging</title>
                <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025-10-07/20251007_frauenkirche.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;Munich&apos;s Frauenkirche&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Munich&apos;s Frauenkirche&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In single-lens imaging, it surprises me how sensitive tuning the lens position becomes, the further the object is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s just the simple rule of geometric optics for imaging with a single lens:&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{f}\]

&lt;p&gt;If the object is a distance $p$ away from a thin lens with focal length $f$, its image will form on the other side of the lens at a distance $q$ away. If we look at the changes of quantities for a fixed focal length we get:&lt;/p&gt;

\[-\frac{dp}{p^2} -\frac{dq}{q^2} =0\]

&lt;p&gt;For imaging a far away object, $p\rightarrow\infty$ and $q\rightarrow f$, hence&lt;/p&gt;

\[\frac{dq}{dp}\approx -\frac{f^2}{p^2}\]

&lt;p&gt;This relation tells us that if the object is much further than one f away from the lens, a tiny variation in the lens-camera distance ($dq$) results in a huge change in the position of the object, i.e. the conjugate plane of the lens ($dp$).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following video, I demonstrate imaging a building about 1300 meters away using a CMOS camera from Allied Vision and an A-coated lens with $f=200$mm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kfUZJvpLUbc&quot; style=&quot;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For clarity, here’s a schematic of this simple experiment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025-10-07/20251007_optics_schematics.png&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; alt=&quot;Schematics of the imaging system&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Schematic of the imaging system&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first coarsly align the lens position by imaging a building nearby (about 100 meters away) and then try shooting far away. I try bringing Munich’s &lt;em&gt;Frauenkirche&lt;/em&gt; into the focus first. Then I try to read the time from the clock on another tower nearby Frauenkirche. The lens is moved in and out to demonstrate the image getting sharp and blurry. To finely adjust the lens position, I zoom into the image frame via the camera program to see the details better.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>My first video on YouTube</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I published my first YouTube video. It is a brief introduction to quantum computing in Persian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025-09-18/20250918-my-first-youtube-video.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot from my first video on YouTube&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I started doing it is mainly to practice presentation skills and telling coherent stories based on the information I possess. I also imagine that this could lead to creating a community of people interested in the same topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first video took me more than 15 hours to prepare! It was mostly because I had many failed attempts. From the early stage of deciding what presentation platform to use (PowerPoint, Notion, web browser, or even writing live on iPad) to figuring out how to sew together short clips into a bigger one, each step needed a bit of experimentation. The hardest part for me, though, was convincing myself that a piece was good enough so that I could move on to making the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m happy about this event for a few reasons. Firstly, I have been thinking about publishing videos based on the things I know and I’m interested in for quite a while. To actually sit down and get it done from 0 to 100% is very different from just planning it in my head and imagining how it could or should look. Now it finally happened, and that imagination has taken form. The fact that it took a certain form brings me to my second reason. Now the &lt;em&gt;direction&lt;/em&gt; to continue further is a bit clearer. I wrote in an &lt;a href=&quot;/deciding-what-to-do-is-hard&quot;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; about how making decisions can be hard and how existing momentum in some direction can help make them easier. Before starting, I had all these routes in my mind about what kinds of things I could talk about. Now I have gained a certain momentum, and at least I know what I want to say and what makes sense to say in my second video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last reason I’m happy about this event is avoiding stagnation. Planning something, watching videos on how to do it, and imagining yourself doing it can be very pleasant and fulfilling. The problem is that this can go on for a while before you realize that nothing has actually happened. That’s why I think taking the first step forward by &lt;em&gt;making&lt;/em&gt; something is an important &lt;em&gt;milestone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that I keep on experimenting with this route and that it actually helps me feel a difference in the skills I seek to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Deciding what to do is hard</title>
                <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025-08-30/20250830_deciding_what_to_do.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Chatgpt&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the Netflix series &lt;em&gt;Dark&lt;/em&gt;, there’s a scene with an old man from the 19th century who has built an entire laboratory in his garage to create a time machine. What struck me wasn’t the machine itself, but where he got his motivation. His father had once told him about time travel, and he decided to devote his whole life to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is fiction, and I don’t take it literally. But it reminded me of a broader theme: deciding what to do with your life feels much harder today than it might have in those days. With the Internet and social media, we now know a lot about many people. We know what can be achieved within 5 or 10 years and that information increases our perceived opportunity cost of choosing any specific path. The more we know, the higher the bar gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learn from Daniel Kahneman and others that decision making pulls from the same mental resources as solving math problems. It’s cognitively expensive. Even in a supermarket, debating whether to buy the chocolate bar by the cashier uses up energy. When it comes to more important things, like deciding what to focus on over the next 10 years of your life, which project to commit to, or how to sort out your values, it becomes even harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even starting this blog came with hesitation. If I write, it means I’m not doing something else: reading books, coding, diving into research papers, or less technical things like spending time with family. That’s the opportunity cost. And yet, there are things to gain: the pleasure of writing, the discipline of committing to a long-term personal project, and maybe a few insights along the way. The real struggle is figuring out how to weigh these trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part of indecision is the stagnation it breeds. You can easily drift into doing nothing at all, simply because no option feels convincingly better than the rest. It becomes easier to convince yourself to do something when there are &lt;em&gt;external forces&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;boundary conditions&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;external force&lt;/em&gt; is the more obvious one—like when you have to do homework for school. By &lt;em&gt;boundary conditions&lt;/em&gt; I mean when you’ve already gained momentum in a specific direction. Then the choice feels less like a dilemma and more like a continuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-now&quot;&gt;What now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the point isn’t to find the perfect decision but to execute and iterate. Start doing something and accept that every choice comes with opportunity costs, and that’s okay. Once you start, you build up momentum and your inertia takes you forward.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>When Logic Hurts</title>
                <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025-08-24/20250824_logic_hurts_ChatGPT_Image.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;From wikipedia&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When talking with friends, I’ve noticed a certain bitterness in strictly logical, precise speech — it can sting and sometimes hurt feelings. I’ve always believed that being logical is a good thing: it makes discussions clearer, provides common ground for arguments, and ensures that everyone avoids confusion or misunderstanding. Yet, it doesn’t always work out for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep conversations strictly logical, you sometimes have to be a little harsh. You need to disagree often, to prevent people from slipping in faulty premises. If someone makes a statistical claim, you feel compelled to check whether they’re using the right reasoning. Everyday conversations are full of hindsight bias, sweeping generalizations, and conclusions drawn from tiny datasets. Even word choice becomes something to police: is it &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;em&gt;All men&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;some men&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;the average man&lt;/em&gt;? You get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a professional setting, this kind of rigor is valuable. But with friends, it often leaves people less happy than when the conversation started — and happiness is kind of the whole point of spending time together. Among friends, we expect to be heard, understood, accepted, and even allowed to make mistakes without feeling judged. Warmth and scrutiny rarely coexist easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People naturally get defensive when criticized. And it’s difficult to face too much criticism at once. Admitting you were wrong is a healthy practice, but it’s also extremely hard to do — maybe because it’s difficult to separate our &lt;em&gt;opinions&lt;/em&gt; from our &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-short&quot;&gt;In short&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logic is an incredible tool, but friendship isn’t a debate. Perhaps the real challenge is knowing when to prioritize accuracy and when to let warmth take the lead. After all, the goal with friends isn’t to win an argument — it’s to share time and leave each other feeling lighter.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>What is an accelerometer?</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An accelerometer is a device that measures linear acceleration. One of the simplest ways to build one is with a &lt;strong&gt;spring–mass system&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a car with a spring and a small test mass mounted inside. One end of the spring is fixed to the car’s body, and the other end is attached to the mass. If we orient the spring along the direction of the car’s motion, the system will respond whenever the car accelerates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
When the engine runs, the wheels push on the ground with a force $-F$, and the ground pushes back on the car with an equal and opposite force $F$. This force accelerates the entire car—including the spring–mass system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s the key: the fixed end of the spring accelerates exactly with the car, while the test mass resists the change in motion, as it is not connected to the car rigidly. The spring stretches or compresses, exerting a restoring force according to Hooke’s law. The displacement of the spring, $\Delta L$, becomes the observable to measure the car’s acceleration. The Hooke’s law applied here is&lt;/p&gt;

\[F - F&apos; = k \, \Delta L,\]

&lt;p&gt;where $k$ is the spring constant, $F$ the total force on the system, and $F’$ the force transmitted to the test mass. By calibrating $\Delta L$ against known accelerations $a$, we can turn spring displacement into a measurement of car’s acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accelerometers-in-free-fall&quot;&gt;Accelerometers in free fall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an interesting twist: a spring–mass accelerometer in free fall does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; measure Earth’s gravitational acceleration ($g = 9.8 \,\text{m/s^2}$). Instead, it reads &lt;strong&gt;zero&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Gravitational force on an object is proportional to its mass. The gravitational force is&lt;/p&gt;

\[F = G \frac{m M}{r^2},\]

&lt;p&gt;with $m$ the mass of the object, $M$ Earth’s mass, $r$ the distance to Earth’s center, and $G$ the gravitational constant. Because this force is proportional to $m$, the acceleration $a = F/m$ is the same for all mass elements of the system. In other words, every part of the spring and the test mass accelerate downward together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there’s no relative acceleration between the parts, the spring does not stretch or compress—it stays in its rest length. That’s why an accelerometer in free fall measures zero: it can only detect &lt;em&gt;proper acceleration&lt;/em&gt; (caused by forces other than gravity), not the pull of gravity itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-this-matters&quot;&gt;Why this matters?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An accelerometer is essentially a tiny spring–mass system that compares how much a test mass lags behind its support. It’s a beautiful example of how a simple physical principle underlies much of our modern technology, from navigation systems in phones to guidance in spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
