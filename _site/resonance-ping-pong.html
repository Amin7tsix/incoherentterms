<p>In ping pong, sometimes a “resonance” happens. A condition where the amplitude of oscillations keeps growing where the amplitude refers to the distance that the players have with the table. Its like a amusement park swing where if you drive it on the natural resonance, it can grow in oscillation amplitude. It is also like a spring-mass system that if you drive it on the natural frequency, it increases its length indefinitely (well…, limited by the length of the spring, but you get the idea!).</p>
