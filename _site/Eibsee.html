<p>Today I went to Lake Eibsee, a beautiful lake in southern Germany, located nearly 1,000 meters above sea level. It sits at the base of Zugspitze, Germany’s highest peak. The lake has this lovely greenish-blue color that I really liked.</p>

According to Wikipedia, its name comes from yew trees that used to grow nearby in large numbers — though now, maybe fewer. I also found it interesting that the lake is privately owned. I’m not quite sure what that means financially, though.</p>

<p>On the way to Eibsee from the nearby town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, I saw a bus stop called “Grainau Schwarzenkopfweg.” In English, that means “Grainau Black Head Way.” When I first saw the word “Schwarzenkopf” (black head), I thought to myself, “How racist!” I know, that was a very simplistic reaction! But honestly, it just popped into my mind because I’d only heard that phrase used before in the context of referring to foreigners from the Middle East and rest of Asia. Later, I realized that “Schwarzenkopf” actually refers to some black rocks along the route that give the area a unique look.</p>
